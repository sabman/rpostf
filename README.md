# Rpostf

Rpostf is a Ruby library to the e-Payment API (v4.4) provided by PostFinance (Swiss Post).

Generate Params/URLs/Forms and validate their responses.

The approach this library is used for works much like 'Google Checkout' or 'Paypal Express'.

This library has been written in context of building webshops on top of
[Spree](http://spreecommerce.com) at [Panter llc](http://panter.ch), Zurich.

## Install

    gem install rpostf

## Example

    pf = Rpostf.new(:login => 'your_login',
                    :sha1outsig => 'somepasswith16digit',
                    :sha1insig => 'someotherpasswith16digits')

    p params = pf.params_for_post(:orderID => rand(1_000_000), :amount => 42)
    p form = pf.form_for_post(:orderID => rand(1_000_000), :amount => 43)
    p url = pf.url_for_get(:orderID => rand(1_000_000), :amount => 44)

## Rpostf & Rails

This is just a suggestion.

config/rpostf.yml

    development:
      login: yourpspidTEST
      sha1insig: someotherpasswith16digits
      sha1outsig: somepasswith16digits
      currency : CHF
      base_url: https://e-payment.postfinance.ch/ncol/test/orderstandard.asp
      accepturl: http://your-dev-deployment/route-to-accept-postfinance-requests
    
    production:
      login: youpspid
      sha1insig: someotherpasswith16digits
      sha1outsig: somepasswith16digits
      currency : CHF
      base_url: https://e-payment.postfinance.ch/ncol/prod/orderstandard.asp
      accepturl: http://your-production-deployment/route-to-accept-postfinance-requests

config/initializers/rpostf.rb

    config_filename = File.join(RAILS_ROOT, %w(config rpostf.yml))
    config = File.open(config_filename) { |f| YAML::load(f) }
    RPOSTF = Rpostf.new(config[RAILS_ENV])

And in the view you might want to add something like...

vender/extensions/your_theme/app/views/checkouts/_payment.html.haml

    -ps = { 'orderID' => @order.number,           |
            'amount' => (@order.total*100).to_i } |
    -url = RPOSTF.url_for_get(ps)
    =link_to t(:checkout_with_postfinance), url, :method => :post

## Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
 * Fork the project.
 * Make your feature addition or bug fix.
 * Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
   future version unintentionally.
 * Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history. (if you
   want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a
   commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
 * Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
